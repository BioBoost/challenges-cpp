# Random Numbers

Checkout the following code: [http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/14057-producing-random-numbers/](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/14057-producing-random-numbers/)

Is uses some functions and libraries to generate random numbers.

Now change the code to print out 10 random numbers between `0` and `100` (both inclusive) while calculating the sum of the randomly generated numbers. No need to use arrays here. Use a for-loop construct for this.

Last also display the sum and average to the user.

## Expected Output

The application should produce the output as shown below:

```text
Welcome to Random Numbers:

Generated these values:
5 23 66 3 100 5 34 88 0 12

The sum is 336
The average is 33.6
```
