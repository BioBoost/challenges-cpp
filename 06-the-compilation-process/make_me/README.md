# Make Me

This small application makes use of a class `Human`. A `Human` has a `name` and can introduce itself (which can be requested by calling the method `to_string()`).

However the project was made by a first grade student which did not finish it completely. The project still contains some syntax errors and their might still be some other bugs too. Luckily the student did provide us with a `Makefile` so the project can easily be compiled.

Try to fix the project so it compiles and generates the same output as shown below.

## Expected Output

The application should produce the output as shown below:

```text
I make therefore I am ...
Hello, my name is Unknown
Hello, my name is Mark
```
