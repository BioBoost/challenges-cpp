# Stats

Stats is an application that tracks a series of numbers in a `vector`. The app allows us to request several statistical properties from the series of numbers, such as:

* average value
* sum
* count
* minimum
* maximum
* variance
* standard deviation

The methods to calculate these values are however not implemented yet. That is your task.

For the last two properties (variance and standard deviation) you can for example use this website: [https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html).

The main of this project contains a small demo app.

## Expected Output

The application should produce the output as shown below:

```text
Serie: 600 470 170 430 300
        => Count: 5
        => Sum: 1970
        => Average: 394
        => Minimum: 170
        => Maximum: 600
        => Variance: 21704
        => Standard Deviation: 147.323
```
