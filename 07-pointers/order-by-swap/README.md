# Order by Swap

Implement the `order()` function so it swaps the `a` and `b` if `a` is bigger then `b`. In other words the function will always return with `a` the smallest value and `b` the largest.

## Expected Output

The application should produce the output as shown below:

```text
8 is the smallest while 12 is the largest
44 is the smallest while 88 is the largest
```
